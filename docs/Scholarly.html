        <p> The purpose of this project is to develop a flexible web-based data 
            visualization tool for Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards actor nominations. 
            The tool will utilize a custom-built REST/GraphQL API to access data 
            related to actor nominations, which will be sourced from The Movie 
            Database (TMDb). The system will provide support for generating statistics 
            and visualizations using at least three different methods, which can be 
            exported in CSV, WebP, and SVG formats. Additionally, the website will 
            support the display of news articles related to each nominated actor, based 
            on configurable external data sources. The goal is to provide users with an 
            intuitive and user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing data related 
            to actor nominations at the SAG Awards.
